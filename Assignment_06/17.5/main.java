Purpose
=======
To solve the Programming Exercise 17.5 (7e 16.21)

    Creating a histogram for occurrences of letters
    -----------------------------------------------
    In Listing (7e 16.12), MultipleWindowsDemo.java,you developed a
    program that displays a histogram to show occurrences of each
    letter in a text area. Reuse the ``Histogram`` class created in
    Listing (7e 16.12) to write a program that will display a histogram
    on a panel. The histogram should show occurrences of each letter in
    a text file, as shown in Figure (7e 16.51). Assume that the letters
    are not case sensitive.
