Purpose
=======
To solve the Programming Exercise 12.7 (7e 13.7)

    Game: Displaying a TicTacToe board
    ----------------------------------
    Display a frame that contains nine labels. A label may display an
    image icon for X, an image icon for O, or nothing, as shown in
    figure (7e 13.16(c)). What to display is randomly decided. Use the
    `Math.random()` method to generate an integer `0`, `1`, or `2`,
    which corresponds to displaying a cross image icon, a not image
    icon, or nothing. The cross and not images are in the files `x.gif`
    and `o.gif`, which are under the `image` directory in
    http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro7e/evennumberedexercise.zip
