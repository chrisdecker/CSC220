Purpose
=======
To solve the Programming Exercise 10.9 (7e 9.9)

    The `Course` class
    ------------------
    * The array size is fixed in Listing (7e 9.6). Improve it to
      automatically increase the array size by creating a new larger
      array and copying the contents of the current array to it.
    * Implement the `dropStudent` method.
    * Add a new method named `clear()` that removes all student from the
      course.
    
    Write a test program that creates a course, add three students,
    removes one, annd displays the students in the course.
