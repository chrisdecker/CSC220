Purpose
=======
To solve the Programming Exercise 10.3 (7e 9.3)

    The MyPoint class
    -----------------
    Design a class named MyPoint to represent a point with x- and
    y-coordinates. The class contains:
    
    * Two data fields x and y that represent the coordinates with get
      methods
    * A no-arg constructor that creates a point at (0, 0).
    * Two get methods for data fields x and y respectively.
    * A method named distance that returns the distance from this point
      to another point of the MyPoint type.
    * A method named distance that returns the distance from this point
      to another point with specified x- and y-coordinates.
    
    Draw the UML diagram for the class. Implement the class. Write a
    test program that creates two points (0, 0) and (10, 30.5) and
    displays the distance between them.
